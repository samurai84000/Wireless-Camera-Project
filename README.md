Wireless Camera Project 


Hello! Welcome to my wireless camera project! I got the idea for a wireless camera project when I realized
that there was no one recording youth sports games in the Minnesota Area. Well, not entirely true, there are
companys that will record youth games, but they have a 3 man crew and charge outragous prices to do so. So now
that I have the Embedded Systems skills from  my time at MSOE, its time to wirelessly control cameras with
a controller and perform the task of 3 people with 1. 

What Microcontroller did I use? I decided on the arduino uno/mega2560 boards for this project. Arduinos easy 
to use IDE and the fact that they have a large library import class makes the platform optimal for creating
robust embedded system projects at a fraction of the cost, and reduced code space. This decision was cemented
when I decided what wireless transceiver to use, the NRF24L01 where arduino has a library already created for 
this peripheral making it an optimal decision.

This project is nearly complete and I intend to post the code here when the project is over. 
Wireless communication is not easy to understand and can take days worth of reading to understand the hardware
and communication protocol like I2C and SPI. Especially when SPI technically has no formal protocal and is
left for the user to pick up the pieces and create their own protocol
